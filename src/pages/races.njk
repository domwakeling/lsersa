    <h2>LSERSA Summer Series</h2>
    <p>We use <a href="https://skiresults.co.uk/" offsite="_results">Ski Results</a> for race entry
        as well as our results.</p>

    <div class="advice-box">
        <p>Race entries close at 7pm on the Wednesday prior to race day so please ensure you
            complete your entry before this deadline to avoid disappointment.</p>
        <p>Race entries may stay open for a limited time after this at an additional fee dependent
            on numbers, but this is solely at the discretion of the committee and once entries are
            finally closed, no more racers will be accepted.</p>
    </div>
    <p>LSRESA runs a summer series each year. Race format is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>three individual slalom runs</li>
        <li>three individual head-to-head dual slaloms</li>
        <li>club- and fun-team dual slaloms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trophies are awarded at each event for top three in age group, based on combined best two
        times from the individual slalom runs.</p>
    <p>There are also overall trophies for each group for the season. This is based on points, which
        are earned based on age-group position at each individual race, together with the individual
        head-to-heads. A racer must score points in three races to be eligible for the overall, and
        points are taken from the best four events.</p>
    <p>Age groups for the current, previous and following year are available on
        <a href="https://gbski.com/lists.php#ages" target="_gbski">GBSki.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Personal Conduct</h2>
    <p>We wish to remind all racers, coaches, parents and spectators that appropriate personal
        conduct is expected at all LSERSA events. Whilst a competitive atmosphere is to be
        encouraged, inappropriate or unsportsmanlike behaviour will not be tolerated and can
        ultimately lead to sanctions, including suspension from LSERSA events. Examples of such
        behaviour include: equipment abuse, swearing, aggressive behaviour, discrimination of any
        form, heated arguments, disrespect shown to any official or volunteer. All LSERSA events are
        "family friendly" environments with appropriate behaviour to be demonstrated at all times.</p>

    <br>
    <hr />

    <h2>Equipment Requirements</h2>
    <p>Please note that minimum appropriate equipment and clothing rules apply at LSERSA races. You
        must wear suitable protection for your arms and legs including long trousers, long sleeve
        shirt, which must cover the midriff, and gloves. Helmets must be worn, and these must comply
        as a minimum to EN1077 (with a visible marking as such) and be in good condition without
        signs of damage. Add-on items such as camera mounts, or protruding edges, spoilers or visors
        are not permitted. LSERSA advise the use of the manufacturers' approved chin guard when
        racing through full gates. Ski poles with a diameter of less than 15mm must be fitted with
        suitable tip protectors to increase the tip diameter to 15mm. These requirements are
        compulsory for all racers in all groups.</p>
    <p>The protective qualities of all safety helmets and face guards are affected by age and use.
        Some older helmets and face guards that have been damaged either in racing by a fall or by
        other impact may no longer provide sufficient protection â€” even if there are no visible
        indications of damage. LSERSA neither specifies nor makes warranties as to the fitness for
        use of any particular ski helmet or face guard nor assumes any responsibilities or duties
        to any competitor by requiring the use of a helmet or face guard. For more information see
