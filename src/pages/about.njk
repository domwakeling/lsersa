    <p>The London &amp; South East Regional Ski Association (LSERSA) was first set up in 1970 to
        represent skiers in the South Eastern counties of England. LSERSA has solid relationships
        with many other regions as well as the Home Nation Governing Bodies (HNGBs). It is one of
        the eight regions that are currently affiliated to Snowsport England (SSE), and through it
        to GB Snowsport.</p>

    <p>In 2006 the region changed its name to the London &amp; South East Regional Snowsports
        Association to reflect the expanding diversity of the region and its members. Today LSERSA
        represents a variety of snowsports clubs including alpine and freestyle skiing,
        snowboarding, telemark and skiercross.</p>
